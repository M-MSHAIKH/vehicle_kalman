# Vehicle State Estimation via Sensor Fusion: Implementation on the Audi A2D2 Dataset Using Various Estimation Algorithms

This project implements various state estimation algorithms to estimate the trajectory  (x,y) of a vehicle based on noisy GNSS measurements. At its core, the system utilizes a Kinematic Bicycle Model to predict the vehicle's motion and fuses these predictions with real-time positional data to produce a smooth, accurate path estimation. For validation the Audi A2D2 opensource dataset is used.
